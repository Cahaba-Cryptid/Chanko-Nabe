================================================================================
GAME CONCEPT
================================================================================

Dystopian management sim. Player manages streamers under a CammTec license.
Make quota or get sent to off-world mining. Everyone's exploiting everyone.

Core loop: Recruit streamers → Train them → Stream for income → Hit quota → Survive

Inspired by HunieCam Studio but bigger scope.

================================================================================
SETTING / STORY
================================================================================

THE WORLD (2075)

Fifty years from now. Climate collapse drove humanity into megacities. Automation
killed most jobs. Universal Basic Income keeps people alive but not comfortable.
The only path to real money is content creation - and CammTec owns it all.

"The Stream" is the only platform that matters. Social media, entertainment,
news, shopping - all consolidated under CammTec's monopoly after the Platform
Wars of the 2050s. They don't just host content; they ARE the internet now.

Content evolved. When everyone's a creator, you need an edge. Fetish content
pays 10x normal rates. CammTec normalized it, monetized it, industrialized it.
Weight gain, feeding, pregnancy - what was once niche is now mainstream premium
content. Streamers aren't just performers; they're commodities with measurable
ROI.

The off-world mining colonies (asteroid belt, Mars) need workers. CammTec has
contracts with the Colonial Labor Authority. Fail to pay your debts? You get
"relocated" to a 20-year mining contract. The recruitment ads call it an
adventure. Nobody comes back to tell you different.

PLAYER SITUATION

You tried the safe route. Fitness content. Lifestyle vlogs. Generic stuff.
Three months in, you're $3,000 in debt to CammTec with declining viewership.
Your account is flagged for "underperformance review."

Then Vex contacts you. She's an AI account manager - one of thousands CammTec
uses to handle their creator base. She has a proposal: pivot to premium content.
Feedism. Weight gain. The stuff that actually pays. She'll guide you, but you
need to recruit talent, manage them, and hit quota. Every week.

Miss quota and CammTec adds penalties. Miss it again and you're in "remediation."
Miss it a third time and the debt collectors come. They're not interested in
payment plans. They're interested in filling mining quotas.

THE TONE

Everyone's exploiting everyone. CammTec exploits creators. You exploit your
streamers. Your streamers exploit their viewers. The viewers exploit the
parasocial relationship. It's dystopian capitalism played straight - dark but
not grimdark. There's gallows humor. Small moments of genuine connection.
The question isn't whether the system is evil; it's whether you can find
something human within it.

FAIL STATE

Debt collectors arrive. You get a one-way ticket to the asteroid belt. Game over
screen shows your "relocation paperwork." Maybe a bleak epilogue about your
first day in the mines. The threat should feel real but not gratuitous.

WIN STATE / ENDGAME

Characters grow so massive they crush an evacuated city. The game culminates in
transcendence - streamers with billions of followers, planetary-scale bodies,
cultural singularity. See PROGRESSION SYSTEM section for details.

================================================================================

================================================================================
ARCHETYPES
================================================================================

calculation, plus passive bonuses. Defined in data/archetypes.json.

GLUTTON (0.2/0.3/0.4/0.1) - Eating content specialist
- +25% capacity training chance
- -10% weight gain

- Starts with $2000 and 1 NPC (others start with $750, 0 NPCs)

Augment Categories:
- Cybernetic: Implants, tech mods (Cybergoth bonus)
- Genetic: Biological modifications (Broodmother bonus)

Fat Distribution by Archetype (belly/bust/hips):
- Default:     70% / 20% / 10%  (standard distribution)
- Glutton:     80% / 10% / 10%  (belly-focused gainer)
- Broodmother: 60% / 25% / 15%  (wider hips for breeding)
- E-Girl:      50% / 35% / 15%  (balanced for appeal)
- Cybergoth:   40% / 45% / 15%  (bust-heavy, augment-enhanced)
- Hucow:       30% / 55% / 15%  (massive bust priority)
- Licensee:    70% / 20% / 10%  (default, management focus)

================================================================================
BODY SIZE SYSTEM
================================================================================

Characters have body part sizes tracked independently from weight. When weight
is gained, it distributes to body parts based on archetype ratios.

SIZE COMPONENTS:

Belly Total = belly_fat + stuffed_contribution + pregnancy_contribution
- belly_fat: Permanent, from weight gain
- stuffed_contribution: Temporary, from stomach_fullness * 0.5
- pregnancy_contribution: bb_factor * 30 (each level adds significant size)

Bust Total = bust_base + bust_fat + milk_contribution
- bust_base: Starting size (default 10, can be modified by augments)
- bust_fat: From weight gain
- milk_contribution: Up to +20 when milk storage is full

Hips Total = hips_fat
- Tracked but not currently used in gameplay

SIZE TIERS (same thresholds for all body parts):
| Tier | Belly Label | Bust Label | Value Range | Scale |
|------|-------------|------------|-------------|-------|
| 0    | Flat        | Modest     | 0-10        | Normal |
| 1    | Soft        | Perky      | 11-25       | Normal |
| 2    | Pudgy       | Full       | 26-50       | Normal |
| 3    | Round       | Heavy      | 51-80       | Large |
| 4    | Huge        | Massive    | 81-120      | Room-filling |
| 5    | Immense     | Enormous   | 121-200     | Furniture-breaking |
| 6    | Colossal    | Colossal   | 201-350     | Building-sized |
| 7    | Titanic     | Titanic    | 351-600     | Block-spanning |
| 8    | Planetary   | Planetary  | 601+        | City-crushing |

GAMEPLAY IMPACT:
- Bigger = better income (audience always prefers bigger)
- Portrait swaps at tier thresholds (future)
- Mobility penalties at extreme sizes (future)
- Size requirements for certain stream kits (future)
- Space limits max achievable tier (see PROGRESSION below)

================================================================================
PROGRESSION SYSTEM
================================================================================

Followers are the primary progression metric. More followers = higher "level".

FOLLOWER RANKS (~25-30 tiers):

Act 1 - Basement Era (Desperate, 50 - 10,000 followers)
| Followers | Rank |
|-----------|------|
| 50        | Nobody |
| 100       | Newbie |
| 250       | Amateur |
| 500       | Hopeful |
| 1,000     | Known |
| 2,500     | Rising |
| 5,000     | Notable |
| 10,000    | Popular |

Act 2 - Warehouse Era (Growing, 10,000 - 1,000,000 followers)
| Followers | Rank |
|-----------|------|
| 25,000    | Trending |
| 50,000    | Famous |
| 100,000   | Star |
| 250,000   | Superstar |
| 500,000   | Icon |
| 1,000,000 | Millionaire |

Act 3 - City Block Era (Transcendent, 1,000,000+ followers)
| Followers     | Rank |
|---------------|------|
| 2,500,000     | Sensation |
| 5,000,000     | Megastar |
| 10,000,000    | Legend |
| 25,000,000    | Global |
| 50,000,000    | Titan |
| 100,000,000   | Planetary |
| 250,000,000   | Continental |
| 500,000,000   | Deity |
| 1,000,000,000 | Singularity |

SPACE UPGRADES:

Each upgrade requires: Follower threshold + Size threshold + Cash payment
Vex prompts upgrade when all requirements are met (requires dialogue system).
Characters CANNOT grow beyond current space's max tier.

| Space | Max Size Tier | Follower Req | Size Req | Cost |
|-------|---------------|--------------|----------|------|
| Basement Apartment | 4 (Huge) | -- | -- | Starting location |
| Vacant Warehouse | 6 (Colossal) | 10,000 | Tier 4 | $50,000 |
| City Blocks | 8 (Planetary) | 1,000,000 | Tier 6 | $500,000 |

STORY BEATS:

Act 1 (Basement): Desperate survival. Just trying to avoid being shipped off as
indentured labor. Cramped quarters, scraping by week to week.

Act 2 (Warehouse): Growth and expansion. Characters are getting too big for the
basement. Move into the vacant warehouse above. More stations, more streamers,
more income potential.

Act 3 (City Blocks): Transcendence. Characters have grown so massive that
multiple city blocks of warehouses must be cleared to accommodate them. Endgame
culminates in characters crushing an evacuated city with their sheer size.

================================================================================
CONTEST STATION (Eating Competition Minigame)
================================================================================

Head-to-head eating competition between player's streamer and a CPU opponent.

CORE MECHANIC:
- Two conveyor belts moving in opposite directions
- Player (yellow oval) and CPU (black circle) positioned between belts
- Each competitor has "home advantage" on one belt (items reach them first)
- Grab food items as they pass, eat them for points
- Competition ends when timer expires, most points wins

BELT LAYOUT:
    [BELT A - moving right →]  ← Player sees items first

    🟡 Player          ⚫ CPU

    [← BELT B - moving left]   ← CPU sees items first

FOOD PREFERENCE SYSTEM:
Three-tier preference adds strategic depth to item selection.

| Reaction | Visual Tell | Points | Effect |
|----------|-------------|--------|--------|
| Like     | ❤️ heart    | +50%   | None |
| Neutral  | Nothing     | Normal | None |
| Dislike  | 😖 grimace  | -25%   | Brief slowdown |

Discovery: CPU shows heart/grimace when eating, player learns their preferences
by observation. Creates mini-game of intel gathering during competition.

FOOD CATEGORIES:
| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Fried    | Tempura, tonkatsu, karaage, fries |
| Rice     | Onigiri, donburi, sushi |
| Noodles  | Ramen, udon, soba, yakisoba |
| Grilled  | Yakitori, yakiniku, grilled fish |
| Sweet    | Mochi, dango, taiyaki |
| Soup/Stew| Miso, curry, oden |

SLOWDOWN STACKS:
Eating disliked food applies slowdown stacks that decay over time.

- Each disliked food eaten: +1 stack
- Stacks reduce movement/grab speed
- Stacks burn off one at a time over time
- Single mistake: Minor setback
- Multiple in a row: Significant slowdown window
- Visual: Stack counter displayed near each competitor

STRATEGIC DEPTH:
- Sniping: Eat CPU's liked food to deny their bonus
- Risk: Their liked food might be YOUR disliked (slowdown penalty)
- Safe snipe: Their liked + your neutral = free denial
- Trap recognition: Food CPU ignores might be disliked by both
- Tempo dance: Exploit opponent's slowdown windows

CPU BEHAVIOR:
No visible "thinking" tells - CPU just acts.

Base behaviors: Idle, Reaching, Eating, Slowed

Decision factors:
1. Is item liked/neutral/disliked?
2. Which belt (home vs away)?
3. Currently eating?
4. Current stack count?
5. Is player going for it?

Personality types:
| Type     | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| Greedy   | Always grabs liked, usually grabs neutral, ignores disliked |
| Sniper   | Only grabs liked, ignores rest (efficient, low risk) |
| Bully    | Grabs liked + anything player wants (denial-focused) |
| Cautious | Only grabs on home belt, never takes disliked |

Difficulty scaling:
| Level  | Reaction Speed | Decision Quality | Spite Factor |
|--------|----------------|------------------|--------------|
| Easy   | Slow           | Often ignores good items | None |
| Medium | Moderate       | Mostly rational  | Occasional |
| Hard   | Fast           | Optimal choices  | Reads patterns |

WIN CONDITIONS:
- Primary: Most food eaten when timer expires
- Alternate formats: First to target amount (future complexity)

CONTEST ECONOMY:

Entry fees and prizes by rank:
| Rank     | Entry Fee | Prize (Win) |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Beginner | $50       | $150 + XP + followers |
| Amateur  | $100      | $350 + XP + followers |
| Pro      | $250      | $800 + XP + followers |
| Elite    | $500      | $1,500 + XP + followers |

Outcomes:
- Win: Prize money + experience + followers + tolerance progress
- Lose: Tolerance progress only (entry fee lost, no other rewards)

CONTEST PROGRESSION:
- One attempt per character per day
- Progression is per-character (each streamer climbs their own ladder)
- Must beat current rank to unlock next rank
- Higher ranks = harder CPU, better rewards

PREFERENCE ASSIGNMENT:
- Player characters: Choose 2 liked, 2 disliked at first contest entry
- Hired NPCs: Random 2 liked, 2 disliked at creation
- Remaining 2 categories are neutral
- Preferences persist permanently

PREFERENCE EVOLUTION:

Grinding path (free):
- Eating disliked food builds tolerance counter for that category
- Threshold: 20 disliked foods eaten → dislike becomes neutral
- Cannot grind past neutral
- Tolerance progress kept even on contest loss

Paid path (Dr. Dan):
- Palate Enhancement: Neutral → Liked
- Only works on neutral categories (must grind out dislike first)
- Escalating cost per enhancement purchased:
  | Enhancement # | Cost |
  |---------------|------|
  | 1st           | $500 |
  | 2nd           | $1,000 |
  | 3rd           | $2,000 |
  | 4th           | $4,000 |

Endgame vacuum: 6 liked categories (requires grinding + $7,500 total)

CONTEST TIMING:
- Duration: 90 seconds per contest

CAPACITY SYSTEM:
Streamer stats directly impact contest mechanics.

Soft Cap = Capacity stat (e.g., 100)
Hard Cap = Capacity + (Stuffing Skill * 10) (e.g., 120 at skill 2)

| Zone | Fullness | Behavior | Bonus |
|------|----------|----------|-------|
| Normal | 0 to Soft Cap | Auto-swallow | None |
| Overstuffed | Soft Cap to Hard Cap | Mash E to force swallow | +25% followers |
| Pass Out | Beyond Hard Cap | Contest loss | N/A |

Fan bonus: Flat +25% multiplier on followers earned while in overstuffed zone.
The crowd loves watching someone push their limits. Requires active mashing
to force food down, risks hitting hard cap. Higher stuffing skill = larger
safe danger zone to play in.

CPU OPPONENTS:
- Fixed pre-made characters chosen randomly from a pool
- Each has set personality, preferences, difficulty rating
- Tournament mode (future): Bracket format with named opponents, adds flavor

INTEGRATION WITH MAIN GAME:
- Contest results provide experience, followers, income
- Food preferences per character add identity
- Capacity/stuffing directly affect contest performance ceiling
