CONTEST MINIGAME
================================================================================

Head-to-head eating competition on conveyor belts.

SETUP:
  - Choose your rank (Beginner, Amateur, Pro, Elite)
  - Higher ranks = harder opponents, better prizes

  - Neutral:  Normal points
  - Disliked: -25% points, brief slowdown, grimace symbol

  Categories: Fried, Rice, Noodles, Grilled, Sweet, Soup/Stew

STRATEGY:

TIPS FOR SUCCESS
================================================================================

3. Balance growth with income - bigger is better but costs food
4. Learn contest preferences - watch what opponents like/dislike
5. Recruit strategically - don't hire more than you can manage
6. Use the Relax station regularly - prevention beats cure
7. Check follower ranks - more followers = better earnings

Good luck, streamer. CammTec is watching.
